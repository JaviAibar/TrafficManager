## About the game

Your job will be to manage the traffic lights in order to optimize the traffic across different levels.

 The goal is to avoid any road user to stop by interacting with each traffic light color duration.

If you manage to configure them so no road user must stop for the time specified upper right, then you'd solved the level!
